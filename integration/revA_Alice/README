Cal Poly Robotics Club - IGVC firmware

The firmware for the IGVC autonomous golf cart project.

The code was built for the ATmega2560, but should work with slight modification for most ATmega chips.

Uses the FreeRTOS Real Time Operating System to provide tasks, as well as semaphores and mutexes. See FreeRTOS.org
